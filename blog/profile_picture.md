## What's Up With the Profile Picture?

Date: 12/28/20

Honestly I have no idea. I created it in 8th grade on some character headshot making website that has long been forgotten. Nevertheless I think it looks pretty dope so I've been using it everywhere since.

Also you might be wondering if the profile picture and my name is off-center on the webpage. The answer to that would be yeah I think so.
