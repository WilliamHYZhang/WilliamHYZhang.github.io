On July 14th, I hopped on a plane from Newark to San Diego and began my California adventures [^1]. I took an overnight bus from San Diego to San Francisco a couple of days later, and then took the BART to Berkeley where I stayed for 2 weeks. While at Berkeley, I went on a couple of day trips to nearby cities like Alameda and Oakland. I went back to San Francisco for a night before taking a plane to Santa Barbara, stayed there for a night and then took a bus to Los Angeles where I'm crashing for two nights before heading back to New York. 


# 1517 Summit
 I finally met my good friends Nima, Calix, and Kevin IRL for the first time, and the amazing folks at 1517 hooked us up with an awesome hotel room overlooking the water. We did a shit ton of really fun stuff like jetskiing and late night workouts. The summit itself was pretty enjoyable, however I wish the alpha density was higher. I met some crazy smart and ambitious people but also people who I honestly believe had the intellectual capacity of a vegetable. In general, the talks were very interesting, however the breakout sessions were a bit less so. Still a great trip to San Diego nonetheless and I would 100% go again!

# SPARC
I remember mentioning that I was going to SPARC on my Twitter but I'm not sure if the news made it into my blog. Anyways, SPARC is the "Summer Program for Applied Rationality and Cognition", also known as "group therapy for nerdy kids" according to Yan Zhang, the director of SPARC. It's a fully-funded competitive summer program that usually attracts top academic olympians (think USAMO, MOP, IMO, USACO campers, etc.) and some startup + research people (I fall into the latter category).

Going into SPARC I definitely felt a little bit different. I'm certain that everyone there was smarter than me in some way or another. However, I quickly settled in to the environment, made some lifelong friends, and had some really insightful/reflective 1 on 1 conversations. The classes were also super interesting, and I really appreciated the high degree of freedom we were given. There were no expectations to attend classes, afternoon activities, or anything to that matter. We were really given the autonomy to do whatever we wanted.

I really can't put into words how fucking fun SPARC was. My friend group that I hung out the most with, the "Fine Nine", consisted of three MOPers, one UAEMOer, three USAMOers, some others but you get the idea. And then there was me, a proud AMC10er LOL. Thank god we didn't talk about math all of the time, the closest we came to that was me creating my first AOPS account and trolling the SPARC thread (follow me please, @AsianHackerasi, the "asi" was a typo but I can't change it anymore).

I got to live with people who were actually cracked at STEM, startups, hackathons, research, etc. - even philosophers! My favorite people included the __Fine Nine__, __ML__ (suitemate, baller, and Exeter kid), __AA__ (roommate, Indian team on the International Philosophy Olympiad which is a story in and of itself, shitload of hackathon wins, and a complete troll), __UG__ (suitemate, Google Code-in winner in my cohort, we did a lot of stuff together over the years), and so many others. I really vibed with everyone so I'll stop here but seriously everyone there was awesome.

Some of my favorite memories from SPARC include:
- Guest speakers Michael Gao and Tina Ju on breaking through mental limits and doing the impossible.
- I kid you not, playing poker every night until 2AM. I religiously studied this game and it got to the point where other campers and even instructors were hiring poker coaches, buying the "David Nagru" poker masterclass, and taking the MIT Poker Theory and Analytics OCW class. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to play 50 hours of poker with geniuses and getting whooped most of the time. Hopefully I can win money with regular plebeians the next time I play :)
- Playing a variant of "A Quiet Year" with Yan, __ML__, __NR__, __RS__, __SW__, and  __UG__. Sooo good.
- Game theory, betting markets, and calibration classes were top notch.
- The best hikes I've even been on, extremely strenuous but worth every step. We went mainly on the Berkeley fire trails. Got to hang out and talk life, girls, tech, and research with my good friends __JA__, __AZ__, and __RA__.
- Late night guy chats with __AA__, __ML__, __AW__, and some others.
- Top Dog and boba runs (I can eat 6 hot dogs at once, and if you ever go to Top Dog in Berkeley make sure to get the garlic frankfurter).
- Beach trips, volleyball, music, spikeball, pool, movies, stadium sneakery, and my first all-nighter (won't be doing that again anytime soon).

SPARC was the absolute best and I can't recommend it enough. Shoutout to __CP__ for recruiting me to the program, I wouldn't have applied if it hadn't been for the personalized email and reminders. I highly recommend this program for really anyone interested in STEM, rationality, cognition, etc.

I still feel like I'm not doing SPARC enough justice, but just know it's more than worth it to attend :)

# EAG
My friends have been hyping up EAG conferences for a while, so I finally decided to apply. Happy that I got in, and EAG SF was quite the interesting experience. For starters, I didn't receive SwapCard access until the day I went there, so couldn't schedule 1 on 1s. A lot of the time was just talking to random people and getting to know the gist of EA a bit better. The food was fucking vegan btw. All in all, I am much more pro-EA compared to before the conference, but I still have concerns about funding methods for longtermism (AI safety, alignment, interpretability). I'll be attending some more EAG conferences in the near future, where hopefully I'll get SwapCard access on time and can schedule some useful 1 on 1s!

# Vibing: Santa Barbara and LA
Quality time surfing, beach walking, and eating amazing food in Santa Barbara and LA. Hanging out with friends and enjoying the last few weeks of summer.

# Closing Thoughts
Seriously loving my time in California. The weather is just soooo fucking nice compared to the shithole of NYC weather. I probably won't live here until I'm like 40 though, this place makes me want to chill, vibe, and get absolutely nothing productive done.

[^1]: A bit of a tangent, but I think people my age and younger should travel solo more. I started with traveling solo to NYC (Manhattan for visiting friends and Brooklyn for work), then made my way up to going alone to Washington DC and Boston for conferences, and now the west coast far away from home. It's been an amazing experience and you get the freedom to explore and meet new people!
