In order to chase success, we have to face failure along the way. Here's a look into my journey so far. I think it's important to share this because it highlights the impact of ambition. To me, successes and failures are just consequences of taking meaningful risks.

I'll try and keep this up-to-date, but this list is very much non-comprehensive.
