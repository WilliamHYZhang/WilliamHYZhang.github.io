Welcome to my website :)

### About

I'm currently a rising senior at [Ward Melville](http://www.threevillagecsd.org/schools/ward_melville_high_school) High School in Setauket, NY. Outside of school I do CS. Besides professional work you can find me tinkering on random side projects, jamming on the sax/drums, or pretty much whatever perks my interest.

### What Am I Currently Doing?
Mainly I'm focusing on
- Software engineering at [Clay](https://www.clay.run/)
- CS theory (security/AI) research with [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)
- Outreach with [Mathisi-fy](https://mathisify.org/)

Other tidbits
- CTFs with [PwnzOrz](https://ctftime.org/team/120438), prev. [RGBsec](https://rgbsec.org/)
- Competitive [programming](https://github.com/WilliamHYZhang/Competitive-Programming)
