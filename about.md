  I'm currently a high school senior based on Long Island, New York. Outside of school, I'm interested in security (crypto/web3) and AI. I like to lift heavy things, eat yummy food, and build cool stuff.

### What Am I Currently Up To?

- Consulting at [Stealth Crypto Startup]
- Software engineering at [<u>Clay</u>](https://www.clay.com/){:target="_blank"}
- Crypto/AI [<u>research</u>](https://www.hydrasec.ml/){:target="_blank"} with [<u>MIT CSAIL</u>](https://www.csail.mit.edu){:target="_blank"}
- Outreach with [<u>Mathisi-fy</u>](https://mathisify.org/){:target="_blank"}

Previously, I've done competitive programming, open-source AI development, freelancing, and cybersecurity CTFs.

Generally, I'm full of ideas that turn into either fun [side projects](https://github.com/WilliamHYZhang/Twitter-Giveaway-Bot){:target="_blank"} or complete [frameworks](https://github.com/WilliamHYZhang/Hydra){:target="_blank"}. Read about my [successes and failures](/posts/successes-and-failures.html), and if you vibe with the kind of work I do, don't hesitate to reach out below.
